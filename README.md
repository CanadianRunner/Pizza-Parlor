## Description
_This is a project I created at Epicodus that allows a user to choose one or more individual toppings.  It also allows the user to select the size and crust type. It makes use of three different input types for the user. This project helped develop my understanding of Object-Oriented JavaScript.   This project represents my ability to navigate HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript/jQuery and Github._

* Navigate to the now installed directory.

## Known Bugs

* Any integar inputted below -1 will cause a RangeError.
